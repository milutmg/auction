# 🚀 ANTIQUE BIDDERLY - HOW TO RUN

## 📁 Project Structure Understanding

The project has this structure:
```
antique-bidderly-1/          # Root directory (this is the CLIENT)
├── package.json             # Client dependencies & scripts  
├── src/                     # React frontend code
├── vite.config.ts          # Frontend build config
└── ...

server/                      # Backend directory (if separate)
└── server.js               # Node.js backend
```

## ✅ Current Status: Servers Running

**Good news**: Both servers are already running!
- ✅ **Frontend (Client)**: http://localhost:8080 
- ✅ **Backend (Server)**: http://localhost:3002

## 🎯 Available Commands

Since you're in the root directory (which is the client), you can run:

### Frontend Commands:
```bash
# Development server (already running on port 8080)
npm run dev

# Build for production  
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm start  # or npm run preview

# Lint the code
npm run lint
```

### Backend Commands:
```bash
# If backend is in separate directory:
cd server/
npm start  # or node server.js

# If backend is in current directory:
node server.js  # (but it's already running)
```

## 🌐 Access Your Application

**Frontend**: http://localhost:8080
- Categories: http://localhost:8080/categories
- Auctions: http://localhost:8080/auctions

**Backend API**: http://localhost:3002/api
- Categories API: http://localhost:3002/api/categories
- Auctions API: http://localhost:3002/api/auctions

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. **Frontend changes**: Edit files in `src/` - changes auto-reload
2. **Backend changes**: Restart the backend server if needed
3. **Both running**: Your app is ready to use!

## 🎉 You're All Set!

The category routing issue has been fixed and both servers are running correctly. Just open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and start using the application!
