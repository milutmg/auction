### Step 3: Browse/Create Auctions
**Option A: Join an existing auction**
1. Navigate to "Browse Auctions" or the auctions page
2. Find an active auction with bids
3. Place a bid higher than the current highest bid
4. Win the auction (wait for timer or place winning bid)

**Option B: Create a test auction (if you have admin access)**
1. Login as admin (admin@example.com / password123)
2. Create a new auction with a short duration (1-2 minutes)
3. Logout and login as test user
4. Bid on and win the auction

### Step 4: Access Won Auction for Payment
1. After winning an auction, navigate to your dashboard
2. Look for "Won Auctions" or "Orders" section
3. Find the auction you won

### Step 6: Complete eSewa Payment (Test Mode)
**Note: This uses eSewa's test environment**

   - Service Code: `EPAYTEST`
   - Success URL: Your app's success callback
   - Failure URL: Your app's failure callback
2. Complete the mock payment process
3. You should be redirected back to the application

### Step 7: Verify Payment Success

   - Success page: `/payment-success`
   - Or failure page: `/payment-failure`
2. Check that payment status is updated in the database
3. Verify the order status has changed to "paid"
